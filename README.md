-  The insights deducted from Customerdata analysis

   - Basic subscriptions bring in the most revenue, making it a top choice among our customers.
   - Basic is the most subscribed option, with over 10 customers choosing this plan, showing it’s quite popular.
   - Over $30 million came from customers who’ve canceled, while active customers contribute about $37 million, which indicates good ongoing engagement despite some turnover
   - The data shows that the average subscription length is about 12 months, or roughly 360 days. This is decent, but there’s room to improve retention and customers 
     onboard.
   - The East stands out with no cancellations with over 8,488 active customers, while the North has the most cancellations (5,067) with only 3,366 active subscriptions, 
     suggesting there is need for better retention efforts.

### Recommendation for SalesData

    - Increase Sales of Low-Selling Items by introducing Promo offers tobundles to boost sales of items like Socks and Jackets by pairing them with popular items like Shoes.
    
    - Special campaigns in the West region and investigate why certain items are not selling in the South and getting feedbacks from customers their options on the 
      products, inorder to make any necessary adjustments.
     
    - For areas that has strong sales in certain month, study the sales trends and use similar strategies to promote the slower months like July, with this will there will 
      be increase in revenue inflow in the upcoming months.

### Recommendation for CustomerData

   - To increase the average duration beyond 12 months, offering benefits or rewards for long-term commitments for customers.
     
   - There is need to carry out more Publicity on Subscription Plans(Basic subscriptions) as well as encourage subscribers by adding adding perks/Incentives to make it even 
     more appealing.

   - Promotional programs such as referrals and campaigns should be targeted in High-Churn Area such as the Northern region which has the highest cancellation subscription.
